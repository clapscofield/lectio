## Introduction
[The Lectio app](http://app-lectio.herokuapp.com/), available online for access, was developed with the aim of facilitating the sharing of research in this project and making available the download of the literature database for a academic community.

The development of the platform took place in sprints, following a Scrum methodology aimed at effective development and visible results. Divided into two main sections - Dataset and PLN - the site was made with **Javascript language using the React framework**. The base of the design was made based on a free [template](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/notus-react), in order to focus on the short development time in delivering the Research and analysis of data results.
